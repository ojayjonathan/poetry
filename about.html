                                <p>Welcome to my poetry project! I am Joan Mokeira, a passionate literature student at Egerton University with a deep love for the written word. This project, "Developing the Love for Poetry," represents my journey through the beautiful and complex world of poetry.</p>
                                
                                <p>As a literature student, I have discovered that poetry is not just about rhyme and rhythmâ€”it's about capturing the essence of human experience in its most distilled form. Through this collection, I hope to share that passion and help others discover the transformative power of poetry.</p>
                                
                                <p>This website serves as both a showcase of poetic works and an educational resource for those who wish to deepen their understanding of poetry. Whether you're a fellow student, a poetry enthusiast, or someone just beginning to explore verse, I hope you find something here that speaks to your heart.</p>
